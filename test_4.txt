Absolutely, Umit! Leveraging your recent skills in data science, machine learning, web development, and app programming to create a multi-platform project sounds like a great challenge. First, we need to choose a project idea that both interests you and allows you to apply these tools—Python, Flask, SQL, Langchain, etc.—as well as implement both a web app and an Android app. Let’s brainstorm some potential project ideas to decide which one suits your goals best. Once the idea is set, I’ll guide you in drafting a user requirements document and visualizing UI/UX designs for each screen. Does that plan work for you?
